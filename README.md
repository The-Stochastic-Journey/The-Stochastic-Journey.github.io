## About Me

I'm Maitreya, a senior PhD student at Arizona State University specializing in the theoretical and applied aspects of generative models—particularly diffusion and flow models. My journey into this field began in 2017 with the advent of GANs like Pix2Pix and CycleGAN, and since then, I've been involved in several exciting projects.

Despite my deep dive into the theoretical intricacies of diffusion and flow modeling, I've often found myself wondering: How were these diffusion models originally invented? What are the mathematical stories behind their development? As a computer science major, I didn't have the opportunity to explore some of the key mathematical foundations—such as Stochastic Differential Equations—that underpin these models.

In my search for a deeper understanding, I noticed a significant gap: there’s a scarcity of resources that trace the evolution from fundamental concepts (like Kolmogorov’s continuity theorems and Brownian motion) to today’s diffusion models. This realization has inspired me to embark on a quest to build a comprehensive, bottom-up view of the mathematics behind these models—one that is both intuitive and theoretically rigorous.

I invite you to join me on this journey as we unravel the math that fuels modern generative models. **Welcome to "The Stochastic Journey."**
